# Introduction #

Webster is a web wrapper around the the Dumbster Project: http://quintanasoft.com/dumbster/.

# Motivation #
There were quite a few of dummy smtp servers out there, but my specific problem was that testers outside of the administration and development group needed to see the emails being sent in testing environments.  This app hopes to provide a way to host a dummy smtp server with universal access.
